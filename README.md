# Travel Tracker

## Abstract
This web application was designed to provide a user-friendly dashboard displaying comprehensive information about a user's past and upcoming trips. Upon logging in with their credentials, users are directed to their homepage where they can easily view their travel history and schedule new adventures. I integrated the application with a local server, enabling it to make network requests to various API endpoints for data retrieval and manipulation. Furthermore, users can seamlessly post to the trips endpoint of the API, instantly reflecting their newly booked trips on the user interface.

## Setup
1. Fork and Clone the Main Repo [repo](https://github.com/sarahcatherine311/travel-tracker):

Go to the main repository on GitHub.
Click on the "Fork" button at the top right to create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.
Once forked, click on the "Code" button and copy the SSH link.
Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
Run the following command: ```git clone [copied SSH link]```

This will create a new folder on your machine with the contents of the repository.

2. In a different folder Fork and Clone the Local Server Repo [local server repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api):

Repeat the steps above for the local server repository.

- Setting Up Dependencies:

For both repositories, you need to install necessary dependencies and start the local servers.
- Install Dependencies and Start the Server:
  Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repo: ```cd [name of the cloned directory]```
  Install the required libraries and dependencies: ```npm install```
  Start the local server: ```npm start``` in the terminal to see the HTML page
  Note: Ensure both repositories are running simultaneously for the app to function correctly.

```Control + C``` is the command to stop running the local server

## Reflections: 
I am currently in the last week of Module Two at the Turing School of Software and Design's Front End Web Development program. This program consists of four modules spanning seven months, and is focused on preparing students for a career as web developers. We work extensively with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the React framework. This is my second solo project, which I completed in 5 days, adhering to the project specifications and rubric detailed [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/travel-tracker.html). 

## Technologies Used:
Javascript | Mocha & Chai | API | CSS | HTML

## Wins/Challenges:
Challenges: 
- Faced complexities while implementing the user login authentication mechanism. The challenges were primarily around extracting and validating the user ID from the input string, ensuring the ID was within an acceptable range. This required string manipulations, value validations, and DOM interactions. Addressing these intricacies provided invaluable insights into form handling in JavaScript.

Wins: 
 - Effectively fetched data from an API.
 - Successfully posted data to an API.
 - Made effective use of iterators.
 - Successfully created a login page.
 - Successfully use of DayJS.
 - Employed Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodologies throughout the project lifecycle
